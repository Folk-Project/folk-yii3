 * Monolog processor that stamps the current Folk request id onto every log record.

 * Reads \Folk\Sdk\Folk::requestId() at log time (not at request start), so it is
 * stateless and cannot leak a stale id between requests on a recycled worker.
 * The id is a UUID added under extra.request_id and omitted entirely when empty
 * (no request in flight, or the Folk extension is not loaded).
 *
 * folk/yii3 does not hard-depend on Monolog: this class is only instantiated
 * when a Monolog logger is present (see FolkBootstrap), so referencing Monolog
 * types here is safe.
